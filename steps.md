1. Generate new project

```js
ng new aucine
```

2. Update Angular version to latest using the Evergreen product
3. Add Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

then init Tailwind CSS

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

add to `tailwind.config.js` the following

```js
content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,ts}",
  ],
```

add tailwind components to `styles.scss`

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

build the app to generate the css file

```bash
ng serve
```

then test that Tailwind works. Replace main component HTML with

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
```

4. Put the general page layout - full screen viewport with fixed header (skip dark mode toggle for now)

5. Add the routing now to prep for Scully

```js
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "",
    redirectTo: "category/now_playing",
    pathMatch: "full",
  },
  {
    path: "category/:collection",
    component: MoviesListComponent,
  },

  {
    path: "movie/:id",
    loadComponent: () => import("./components/movie-detail.component").then((m) => m.MovieDetailComponent),
  },
  {
    path: "**",
    redirectTo: "category/now_playing",
    pathMatch: "full",
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

6. Create the `MoviesListComponent` and `MovieDetailComponent` components

```bash
ng g c components/movies-list --standalone -s --selector MoviesList -c OnPush
ng g c components/movie-detail --standalone -s --selector MovieDetail -c OnPush
```

7. Update the `app.component.html` to add the router outlet

```html
<div class="flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-zinc-900 text-white">
  <header class="container mx-auto flex flex-col py-5 text-white">
    <!-- logo markup -->
  </header>
  <main class="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-5">
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 pt-16 mb-16">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>
  </main>
</div>
```

8. Add Scully early on if possible

```bash
ng add @scullyio/init
```

Restart app and run `ng serve` again, the `scully init` should generate the `scully.<projectName>.config.ts` file

9. If the config file is not created go through the manual installation steps. You cn find the documentation [here](https://scully.io/docs/learn/getting-started/manualInstallation/)

- 9.1 - Add the `scully ng-lib` to the project

```bash
npm i @scullyio/ng-lib
```

- 9.2 - Then import `ScullyLibModule` into your `app.module.ts`

- 9.3 - Now create a `scully.[PROJECT_NAME].config.ts`, replacing [PROJECT_NAME], with the name of your Angular project. Then add the content of the Scully config file like shown below:

```js
import { ScullyConfig } from "@scullyio/scully";

export const config: ScullyConfig = {
  projectRoot: "./src",
  projectName: "aucine",
  distFolder: "./dist/aucine", // output directory of your Angular build artifacts
  outDir: "./dist/static", // directory for scully build artifacts
  defaultPostRenderers: [],
  routes: {},
};
```

- 9.4 - Create a `plugins` directory.
  At the root of your project folder, if it doesn't already exist, create a directory called `scully` do not confuse it with the folder named `.scully` that might've already been created in one the steps before. Inside the `scully` directory, create a `tsconfig.json` file with the following content:

```json
// ./scully/tsconfig.json
{
  "compileOnSave": false,
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "importHelpers": false,
    "lib": ["ES2019", "dom"],
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es2018",
    "types": ["node"],
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "skipDefaultLibCheck": true,
    "typeRoots": ["../node_modules/@types"],
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "exclude": ["./**/*spec.ts"]
}
```

Then, create a plugins directory inside the scully directory, and add a file named plugins.ts, with the following content:

```js
// ./scully/plugins/plugins.ts
import { registerPlugin, getPluginConfig } from "@scullyio/scully";

export const myPlugin = "myPlugin";

const myFunctionPlugin = async (html: string): Promise<string> => {
  return html;
};

const validator = async () => [];

registerPlugin("render", myPlugin, myFunctionPlugin, validator);
```

10. Now build the app and run Scully

```bash
ng build --prod
```

`--prod` may be redundant in newer versions of Angular

After the build - if succesfull you will have a `dist` folder with an `aucine` subfolder - run

```bash
npx scully --project aucine
```

If you have an error that `puppeteer` is missing, install it first

```bash
 npm install @scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer
```

then run the scully command again

actually let's save the command in the `package.json` file

```json
"scripts": {
    // other scripts
    "scully": "npx scully --project aucine"
  },
```

and now you can simply run `npm run scully` to generate the static site

11. Running the static site with `scully serve`
    Let's add a new entry to our package.json file to run the static site with `scully serve`

```json
"scripts": {
    // other scripts
    "scully": "npx scully --project aucine",
    "scully:serve": "npx scully serve"
  },
```

This will by default serve two versions of the site:

- the static version residing on `dist/static` on port `:1668`
- the Angular version residing on `dist/aucine` on port `:1864`

Please note that only all your explicit routes will be statically generated. We will show how to generate static version of dynamic routes in the section 13.

12. Running the static site with `http-server`
    We will need to run a server locally to test the static site. If you do not have a server installed, you can install `http-server` globally. Here is the [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to the npm package. Below are a few installation options.

### Running on-demand:

Using npx you can run the script without installing it first:

```bash
npx http-server [path] [options]
```

### Globally via npm

```bash
npm install --global http-server
```

This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line anywhere.

### As a dependency in your npm package:

```bash
npm install http-server
```

After install navigate to `dist/static` and run `http-server` :

```bash
cd dist/static && http-server .
```

13. Let's tackle the dynamic routes
    Looking at the current state of our app we have the root route and two dynamic routes. Scully has a simple very straightforward plugin system that allows us to create plugins to handle dynamic routes. Let's create a plugin to handle the dynamic routes.

Add a redirect to our root component (we will remove later on) and add more semantic routes

```js
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "",
    redirectTo: "movies/now_playing",
    pathMatch: "full",
  },
  {
    path: "movies/:collection",
    component: MoviesListComponent,
  },

  {
    path: "movie/:id",
    loadComponent: () => import("./components/movie-detail/movie-detail.component").then((m) => m.MovieDetailComponent),
  },
  {
    path: "**",
    redirectTo: "movies/now_playing",
    pathMatch: "full",
  },
];
```

Running the `npx run scully` command we see that we still have only one page generated which is the root page. Let's create a plugin to handle the dynamic routes.

Navigate to `./scully/plugins`. Scully comes with different types of plugins, you can read about all the types [here](https://scully.io/docs/Reference/plugins/overview/)

We will create a `router` plugin. Add these imports to your `scully.aucine.config.ts` file

```js
import { registerPlugin, getPluginConfig, HandledRoute } from "@scullyio/scully";
```

Now add the following function:

```js
// movies collection plugin
function moviesCollectionPlugin(route: string = "", config = {}): Promise<HandledRoute[]> {
  return Promise.all([{ route: "/movies/now_playing" }, { route: "/movies/popular" }, { route: "/movies/top_rated" }, { route: "/movies/upcoming" }]);
}

const moviesValidator = async () => [];

registerPlugin("router", "moviesPages", moviesCollectionPlugin, moviesValidator);
```

and now in the `config` object under `routes` add the following:

```js
routes: {
    '/movies/:collection': {
      type: 'moviesPages',
    },
  },
```

and run `npm run scully` again. You should see that now we have 5 pages generated. The root page and the 4 dynamic routes.

if you still see only one page generated add an `extraRoutes` property to the `config` object and add the path explicitly

```js
extraRoutes: ['/movies/:collection'],
```

Now we should have all the pages generated. Let's check in our `dist/static` folder.

We can see now we have a `movies` folder which contains a subfolder of each of the dynamic routes with a root `index.html` file.
